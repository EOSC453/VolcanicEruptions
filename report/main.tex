% Introduction and Overview
\section{Introduction}
Anthropogenic global warming is an identifier of climate change and a defining 
issue of our time. It is thought to be the main trigger of intensified, more frequent
extreme weather events, sea-level rise with the potential
to displace millions, and loss of large freshwater reservoirs.
The question of why, and how, climate change operates, and what we can do to mitigate 
its effects during our lifetime, is an arduously nonlinear problem that climate scientists
still battle with, both in the laboratory and in politics. Within this contention, we focus on
how large local out-gassing events of volatils such as sulfur dioxide during volcanic eruptions
have historically affected the Earth's climate. Here we chose to investigate
the impact of volcanic perturbations on a simple radiative
energy balance model. Throughout this paper we will only consider the effect of aerosols,
and more specifically, SO2. This model is inspired by the
work of Russian climatologist Mikhail I. Budyko, who discovered the ice-albedo
feedback mechanism underlying climate change through his pioneering of studies
on global climate using physical models of equilibrium (eq of what???) (\cite{budyko_albedo}).
We proceed as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Build a graphical algorithm solving the radiative energy balance equations in a zonally-averaged Earth model,
based on figure 1
    \item Compute the present, steady-state energy balance of the Earth to investigate the effect of
intra-zonal transfer by:
        \item setting all transfer coefficients kij to zero
        \item using the provided values of kij and comparing heat transfer magnitude and rates from our previous step
    \item from \cite(Robock 2000) from the 1982 El Chichón and Pinatubo eruption introduce a \phi(t) function representing the spatially
    and temporally reducing effects of aerosol outgassing on the incoming radiation
    \item Consider a nonlinear effect of temperature on albedo.
    \item Using this new albedo parameterization as a proxy for the "ice-albedo" feedback, we look for solutions favourable to Snowball Earth
conditions.
    \item We then implement a Poisson sampling of eruptions to investigate a volcanic solution to Snowball Earth  
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Budyko Climate Model}
The evolution of Earth's temperature will be investigated using a Budyko
climate model \parencite{budyko_albedo}. The earth is divided into 6 latitudinal
zones, defined by the latitudes shown in table \ref{tab:latitudes} and figure
\ref{fig:zones}.

\begin{table}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{ c | c | c }
        \hline
        \thead{Zone} & 
        \thead{Lower Latitude} &
        \thead{Upper Latitude} \\
        \hline
        1 & $90^\circ S$ & $60^\circ S$ \\
        2 & $60^\circ S$ & $30^\circ S$ \\
        3 & $30^\circ S$ & $0^\circ$ \\
        4 & $0^\circ$ & $30^\circ N$ \\
        5 & $30^\circ S$ & $60^\circ N$ \\
        6 & $60^\circ S$ & $90^\circ N$ \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Zone latitudes.}
    \label{tab:latitudes}
\end{table}

\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{zones.png}
    \caption{Latitude zone intervals.}
    \label{fig:zones}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier

Within each zone, temperature evolves through radiative heat fluxes entering the
earth through solar radiation, heat fluxes leaving the earth as long-wave
radiation and the exchange of heat between zones. These effects are quantified
through
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:budyko}
    \frac{dT_k}{dt} = \frac{1}{\mean{\rho_kc_k[Z_k]}}
    \{
      \gamma_k(1-\alpha_k^{sky})(1-\Bar{\alpha}_k)S_0-\tau\sigma_BT_k^{4}
    \} +
    \frac{L_{ki}k_{ki}}{{A_k}\mean{\rho_kc_k[Z_k]}}(T_{k}-T_{i})
\end{equation}
where $k = 1,\dots,6$ represents each latitudinal zone and $T_k$ is the zonal
temperature. The remaining constants are defined in tables \ref{tab:zoneparams}
and \ref{tab:globalparams} of section \ref{sec:Parameters}.

\subsection{Volcanic Eruptions} \label{sec:Volcanos}
Volcanism is an important natural cause of climate change across a range of
timescales \parencite{robock}. For our investigation, we consider the
short-term cooling effects of volcanism that occur on a $10-100$ year time frame.
These cooling effects are introduced in our model by applying an occlusion factor,
$\phi(t)$, to each zone in the model. The
occlusion factor represents the presence of volcanic aerosols suspended in the
atmosphere that block direct shortwave solar radiation.
The introduction of $\phi_k(t)$
transforms equation \ref{eqn:budyko} to
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:occlusion}
\frac{dT_k}{dt} = \frac{1}{\mean{\rho_kc_k[Z_k]}}
\{
    \phi_k(t)\gamma_k(1-\alpha_k^{sky})(1-\Bar{\alpha}_k)S_0-\tau\sigma_BT_k^{4}
\} +
\frac{L_{ki}k_{ki}}{{A_k}\mean{\rho_kc_k[Z_k]}}(T_{k}-T_{i})
\end{equation}
A value of $\phi(t) = 1$ represents no volcanic aerosol occlusion. A value
of $\phi(t) = 0.7$, for example, represents a $30\%$ reduction in total
incoming solar radiation.

\subsubsection{Direct Radiation Occlusion} \label{sec:Occlusion}
Based on observations of the reduction of solar radiation after the
1982 El Chichón eruption and the 1991 Pinatubo eruption \parencite{robock},
an empirical curve for $\phi(t)$ was fit to the data, as shown
in figure \ref{fig:occlusion}. We found that a function with the form
$\phi(t) = 1 - ct^{-2}$, where $c=5.36$ yr$^2$ is an empirical constant found through
nonlinear regression, gave a reasonable representation of the data.
Moreover, this function has the property that $\phi(t) \to 1$ as $t \to \infty$,
which models the decaying effects of aerosol occlusion over time.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{occlusion.pdf}
    \caption{
        Plot of $\phi(t)$; occlusion factor. An occlusion factor of 0.7
        represents a $30\%$ reduction in total incoming solar radiation.
    }
    \label{fig:occlusion}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier

\subsubsection{Spatial Distribution of Aerosols} \label{sec:Spatial_Occlusion}
The effects of a volcanic eruption are not local to a single zone. Suspended
aerosols are dispersed throughout the atmosphere and can travel large distances
across the Earth. To model the spatial effects of aerosol dispersion following
an eruption, a time lag is introduced to the zonal occlusion functions,
$\phi_k(t)$, that varies based on the distance zone $k$ is from the eruption
zone. An example is shown in figure \ref{fig:occlusion_space}, where an eruption
occurs at $t=0$ in zone $1$. For the first $3$ months following the eruption,
only zone 1 has the occluding effects of volcanic aerosols. After $3$ months,
the aerosols have traveled to the adjacent zone 2, where $\phi_2(t)$ begins
to follow the decaying occlusion function defined in section \ref{sec:Occlusion}.
This process continues until the entire earth is affected by the volcanic
aerosols after approximately 9 months. The specific lag times considered in the
model were estimated from the data presented in \cite{robock}.

    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{occlusion_space.pdf}

        The spatial effect of eruptions. A distance-dependent time lag is
        present for zones adjacent to the eruption.
    }
    \label{fig:occlusion_space}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier

\subsubsection{Stochastic Eruption Frequency} \label{sec:Stochastic}
Sections \ref{sec:Occlusion} and \ref{sec:Spatial_Occlusion} define our model's
response to a single eruption. To investigate the intensity of
volcanism on the Earth's climate, we allow for a series of eruptions to occur
over time. Volcanic eruptions in each zone are modeled as a Poisson
process, where each zone is prescribed an eruption frequency intensity,
$\lambda_k$, that reflects the average repose time between eruptions in the zone.
For an eruption intensity $\lambda_k$, the probability of a repose time, $t_{R}$,
between eruptions follows an exponential distribution
\begin{equation} \label{eq:exponential}
P(t_{R}) = \lambda_k e^{-\lambda_k t_{R}}
\end{equation}
For this investigation, we assume eruptions occur independently in each zone. \\

The intensity of volcanic activity on Earth can be adjusted by raising or
lowering each zone's $\lambda_k$. A smaller $\lambda_k$ represents shorter repose
times and higher volcanic activity. Combining equation \ref{eq:exponential} with
the occlusion function defined in sections \ref{sec:Occlusion} and
\ref{sec:Spatial_Occlusion} gives a simple stochastic model for volcanism on
Earth that includes the time-decaying effects of aerosol occlusion, the spatial
dispersion of aerosols and temporal volcanic intensity.

\subsection{Ice-Albedo Feedback} \label{sec:Ice}
The volcanism defined in section \ref{sec:Volcanos} provides a mechanism to
cool the Earth by occluding direct solar radiation with suspended volcanic
aerosols. One interesting way to study the implications of this cooling is by
considering the ice-albedo feedback \cite{budyko_albedo}. The idea of the
ice-albedo feedback is that if the temperature of the Earth is cold enough,
ice will grow and cover a larger proportion of the Earth's surface. This
will result in a higher surface albedo, reflecting the incoming solar radiation.
The higher albedo will further contribute to decreasing the temperature of
the Earth, leading to a positive feedback. This runaway cooling has the potential
to completely cover the Earth in ice, leading to a ``Snowball Earth'' scenario. \\

We model the ice-albedo feedback by defining a temperature dependent albedo
as follows
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:albedoparam}
    \alpha_k(T_k) =
      \begin{cases}
      \alpha_{k0} & T_k \geq T_0 \\
      \alpha_{k0} + (\alpha_i-\alpha_k)\frac{(T_k-T_0)^2}{(T_i-T_0)^2}
      & T_i < T_k < T_0 \\
      \alpha_i & T_k \leq T_i
      \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_k$ is the albedo in zone $k$, $T_k$ is the temperature in
zone $k$, $T_0 = 280$ K is the threshold temperature where we allow the
growth of ice to increase the albedo, $T_i = 250$ K is the temperature
where the zone is completely covered in ice, $\alpha_{k0}$ is the baseline
zonal albedo given in table \ref{tab:zoneparams} and $\alpha_i = 0.6$ is the
albedo of ice. Figure \ref{fig:albedotemp} shows the nonlinear albedo function
for each zone.

\section{Results}
\label{section:results}
In this section, we will report on data obtained via our three forms of volcanic
perturbations and describe the behaviours of these perturbations within the
context of the data itself.

\subsection{Steady-State Climate Model: No Volcanism}
By passing initial condition temperatures calculated through our model with
suppressed inter-zonal transfer (See Table \ref{tab:supressedteq}) to our
steady-state model where inter-zonal transfer is allowed, we solve for the
equilibrium temperatures by integrating forward in time
(Figure \ref{fig:steadystate}).

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Question2.png}
    \caption{
        Equilibrium solution for 6-zoned Earth climate model. Zone 1 marks the
        southernmost band at $60-90^{\circ}$S while zone 6 represents the
        northernmost band at $60-90^{\circ}$N. Zones 2-5 are bands covering
        $30^{\circ}$ intervals between zones 1 and 6
        (See Figure \ref{fig:zones}).
    }
    \label{fig:steadystate}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier

There are a few key observations to note. The first is that a larger transfer
coefficient (\ref{tab:boundaryparams}), representing the northern Gulf Stream
between zones 4 and 5, produces a large initial temperature gradient in these
zones relative to the others (solid colour lines in Figure
\ref{fig:steadystate}). The second is that the highest temperature zones at
equilibrium are 3 and 4, and the lowest temperature zones at equilibrium are 6
and 1. All zones approach an equilibrium temperature between $274.1^{\circ}$K
and $282.3^{\circ}$K after a model year. (Table \ref{tab:teq}). By reducing the
inter-zonal transfer coefficient between zones 4 and 5
(dashed lines in Figure \ref{fig:steadystate}), we can alter the characteristics
of a few zones dramatically. The most obvious of which are zones 4, 5, and,
perhaps surprisingly, zone 6. These alterations include a reduction in the
initial rate of change in temperature and will be analyzed further in Section
\ref{section:steadystate}.

\subsection{Climate Model Following Single Volcanic Eruption}
To introduce the effect of volcanism to our model, we add an occlusion factor,
$\phi(t)$, to each zone that reduces total incoming solar radiation
(Figure \ref{fig:occlusion}). $\phi_k(t)$ varies in initial magnitude and onset
time based on proximity to the zone in which the eruption occurs. Alternatively,
an eruption in zone 3 will have a reduced effect in zone 4 and 2 to simulate
the thinning of aerosol density as the cloud spreads, and the aerosols have a
travel time before the effect is felt in adjacent zones. $\phi(t)$ follows a
$\frac{1}{t^2}$ fit to eruption data from \cite{robock} such that
$\lim_{t\to\infty}\phi(t) = 1$.
Figure \ref{fig:oneerupt} shows our solution post eruption.

\subsection{Stochastic Volcanic Eruptions}
Figure \ref{fig:stocherupt} shows a model result that includes multiple
eruptions following the Poisson process defined in section \ref{sec:Stochastic}.
Vertical dashed lines represent an eruption with a coloured by the zone the eruption
occurred. The eruption intensity parameters used are given in table

    }
    \label{fig:stocherupt}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier

The model was run for 100 years to show multiple cycles of temperature
drops and recoveries. From Figure
\ref{fig:stocherupt}, we see that following each eruption is a decline in zonal
temperatures, and sufficiently close eruptions, in time, compound that effect.
The distribution lag associated with aerosol spreading is still represented
numerically, though a lag of a few months is difficult to discern visually on
this extended time scale. 

\subsection{The Ice-Albedo Effect} \label{sec:ice_albedo_results}
Figure \ref{fig:albedo_equil} shows the result of the temperature dependent albedo
from in equation \ref{eqn:albedoparam} coupled with our climate model in
equation \ref{eqn:budyko}. The temperature ranges for the nonlinear albedo model
are coloured similar to figure \ref{fig:albedotemp}. We recognize three temperature equilibria,
two of which are stable and one that is unstable. The equilibrium temperature
distributions are shown in table \ref{tab:eqstates}.

The stable eruption frequency model oscillates around the warm Earth equilibrium
shown in section \ref{sec:ice_albedo_results}. The unstable eruption frequency
oscillates around the warm Earth equilibrium for approximately
$70$ years before it quickly drops to oscillate around the snowball
Earth equilibrium.

\section{Discussion}
Here we will discuss the possible processes behind the numerical behavior of our
Figures in Section \ref{section:results} in order to elucidate the connection
between our mathematical and computational results with their underlying
physics.

\subsection{Steady-State Climate Model: No Volcanism}
\label{section:steadystate}
Zones 4 and 5 experience a large initial temperature gradient due to a heat
transfer coefficient indicative of Gulf Stream circulation processes that is
larger than the transfer coefficients between other zones
(Figure \ref{fig:steadystate}). This causes zones 4 and 5 to approach their
equilibrium values more quickly. For example, zone 5 reaches its approximate
equilibrium temperature within the first two months of the model year because
the efficiency of heat transfer between these zones is greater than between
others. \\

Zones 3 and 4 are the warmest zones due to their proximity to Earth's equator.
Both lie within $30^{\circ}$N/S of the equator, and hence have the largest
effective surface area, coupled with a low albedo due to a high land and sea
fraction versus ice fraction (See Table \ref{tab:zoneparams}). This increases
these zones' retention of incoming solar radiative heating by reducing the
amount lost to space as out-going, long-wave radiation (OLR). Zone 3 may be
hotter than zone 4 due to smaller transfer coefficients between its adjacent
zones than compared with zone 4, where heat transfer occurs rapidly due to
influence from the Gulf Stream across the boundary of zone 4 and 5. \\

Conversely, zones 1 and 6 are the coldest zones at equilibrium due to their
placement at Earth's high latitudes ($>60^{\circ}$N/S). This reduces their
effective surface area such that less total solar insolation occurs, alongside
a higher albedo due to a dominating ice fraction. This causes the OLR to be
larger relative to incoming radiative heating than in the case of the other
zones. Hence, temperature at equilibrium in zones 1 and 6 is lower. Zone 1 may
be colder than zone 6 due to a higher albedo associated with a marginally larger
ice fraction that increases OLR even relative to zone 6. \\

Comparing the solid and dashed lines in Figure \ref{fig:steadystate}, there is a
general trend of reduced rate of change in temperature for several northern 
latitudinal zones. Zones 4 and 5 experience the greatest deviation from the
original approach to equilibrium as this change is at their boundary of
separation and directly reduces the amount of heat exchange between them.
Zone 6 also experiences a reduction in the rate of approach to equilibrium due
to its nonlinear relation with zone 5. As we can see, these effects are
compounded in zones closest to zones 4 and 5, such that at sufficient
separation, approaches to equilibrium are not noticeably affected. This is
evident in zones 2 and 1, and suggests they have little dependence on
temperature characteristics within the northern zones.

temperature-dependent parameterization of albedo. This coupling is shown in
Figure \ref{fig:fireandice}, and will be discussed after looking at the
mechanisms in isolation. \\

The interval post-origin for stochastic eruptive behaviour has been extended to
100 years visualize a return to equilibrium more clearly. From Figure
\ref{fig:stocherupt}, we see that following each eruption is a decline in zonal
temperatures, and sufficiently close eruptions, in time, compound that effect.
The distribution lag associated with aerosol spreading is still represented
numerically, though a lag of a few months is difficult to discern visually on
this extended time scale.

To incorporate variable albedo, we define a piece-wise albedo parameterization
dependent on zonal temperature (Adapted from \cite{jellinek_ps}).
The parameterization follows the form of Equation\ref{eqn:albedoparam}
(Section \ref{sec:eqns}), and ascribes behavior based on each zone's basal
albedo and temperature range (Figure \ref{fig:albedotemp}). Temperatures above
$280^{\circ}K$ allow each zone to take on their originally defined albedo,
$\alpha_k$ (See Table \ref{tab:zoneparams}). Temperatures below $250^{\circ}K$
replace these with a constant ice albedo, while the interval between describes a
quadratic growth from $\alpha_k$ to $\alpha_i$ as temperature declines.

By coupling these processes, and ranging through a series of initial temperature
conditions in each zone, we are able to find a numerical snowball Earth in
Figure \ref{fig:fireandice}. Similarly to our observations of Figure
\ref{fig:stocherupt}, eruptions that happen close in time have a compounded
effect of driving temperatures down further. After several eruptions between
$1.75e9-2.1e9$ seconds, this effect causes temperatures to drop below the lower
threshold of our albedo parameterization, $T_i$ and plummet to a new state
between approximately $225-245^{\circ}K$. This phenomenon will be expanded on
in Section \ref{sec:snowballearth}.

\section{Discussion}
Here we will discuss the possible processes behind the numerical behavior of our
Figures in Section \ref{section:results} in order to elucidate the connection
between our mathematical and computational results with their underlying
physics.

\subsection{Steady-State Climate Model: No Volcanism}
\label{section:steadystate}
Zones 4 and 5 experience a large initial temperature gradient due to a heat
transfer coefficient indicative of Gulf Stream circulation processes that is
larger than the transfer coefficients between other zones
(Figure \ref{fig:steadystate}). This causes zones 4 and 5 to approach their
equilibrium values more quickly. For example, zone 5 reaches its approximate
equilibrium temperature within the first two months of the model year because
the efficiency of heat transfer between these zones is greater than between
others. \\

Zones 3 and 4 are the warmest zones due to their proximity to Earth's equator.
Both lie within $30^{\circ}$N/S of the equator, and hence have the largest
effective surface area, coupled with a low albedo due to a high land and sea
fraction versus ice fraction (See Table \ref{tab:zoneparams}). This increases
these zones' retention of incoming solar radiative heating by reducing the
amount lost to space as out-going, long-wave radiation (OLR). Zone 3 may be
hotter than zone 4 due to smaller transfer coefficients between its adjacent
zones than compared with zone 4, where heat transfer occurs rapidly due to
influence from the Gulf Stream across the boundary of zone 4 and 5. \\

Conversely, zones 1 and 6 are the coldest zones at equilibrium due to their
placement at Earth's high latitudes ($>60^{\circ}$N/S). This reduces their
effective surface area such that less total solar insolation occurs, alongside
a higher albedo due to a dominating ice fraction. This causes the OLR to be
larger relative to incoming radiative heating than in the case of the other
zones. Hence, temperature at equilibrium in zones 1 and 6 is lower. Zone 1 may
be colder than zone 6 due to a higher albedo associated with a marginally larger
ice fraction that increases OLR even relative to zone 6. \\

Comparing the solid and dashed lines in Figure \ref{fig:steadystate}, there is a
general trend of reduced rate of change in temperature for several northern 
latitudinal zones. Zones 4 and 5 experience the greatest deviation from the
original approach to equilibrium as this change is at their boundary of
separation and directly reduces the amount of heat exchange between them.
Zone 6 also experiences a reduction in the rate of approach to equilibrium due
to its nonlinear relation with zone 5. As we can see, these effects are
compounded in zones closest to zones 4 and 5, such that at sufficient
separation, approaches to equilibrium are not noticeably affected. This is
evident in zones 2 and 1, and suggests they have little dependence on
temperature characteristics within the northern zones.

This model only investigates the effects of SO2 on the energy balance, not considering
the influence of CO2. CO2 is a greenhouse gas, meaning that it efficiently absorbs the
incoming solar radiation Volcanic eruptions
